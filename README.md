# Flash Chat - Real-time Cloud Messaging App 💬

Flash Chat is a modern messaging application that uses a cloud-based backend to allow users to register, login, and send real-time messages. This project was developed to master complex iOS components like TableViews, Firebase Firestore, and third-party library integration.

##  What I Learned & Implemented:
* **Firebase Firestore**: Integrated a cloud-based NoSQL database to store and retrieve messages in real-time.
* **User Authentication**: Implemented secure registration and login flows using Firebase Auth.
* **Custom TableViews**: Created custom message cells using `.xib` files and managed data sources and delegates.
* **Cocoapods & SPM**: Gained experience in managing third-party dependencies.
* **Navigation Stack**: Managed app flow using `UINavigationController` and Segues.
* **App Lifecycle**: Utilized `viewWillAppear` and `viewWillDisappear` to manage UI states effectively.
* **Constants Organization**: Implemented a robust `Constants.swift` file with static properties for type-safe code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language**: Swift
* **Backend**: Firebase Firestore & Auth
* **UI**: UIKit (Storyboards & XIBs)
* **Design Pattern**: MVC
